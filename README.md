## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a retail order dataset using the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process. The goal was to extract data, clean and transform it, then load it into a SQL database for querying and further analysis. The final insights were visualized using Tableau to create an interactive dashboard.

## Steps and Skills Demonstrated

### 1. ETL Process Execution
- **Extract:** Utilized Kaggle API to fetch the retail order dataset into VSCode, showcasing proficiency in data extraction from external sources.
- **Transform:** Conducted data cleaning and transformation using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques. Created additional columns to enhance the depth of analysis, such as `sale_price` and `profit`.
- **Load:** Loaded the clean data into a SQL database for structured querying.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Transformation
- Cleaned the dataset by removing unnecessary columns and formatting the remaining data for consistency and accuracy.
- Generated new columns to facilitate deeper analysis, demonstrating data manipulation skills.

### 3. SQL Querying and Analysis
- Formulated complex SQL queries to address specific business questions:
  1. Identified the top 5 highest revenue-generating products.
  2. Determined the top 5 highest selling products in each region.
  3. Compared month-over-month sales growth for the years 2022 and 2023.
  4. Found the date with the highest sales for each product category.
  5. Analyzed the sub-category with the highest sales growth in 2023 compared to 2022.
  6. Calculated the average discount and total sales for each segment and ship mode.
- Exported the query results for further visualization.

### 4. Data Visualization in Tableau
- Imported the SQL query results into Tableau to create an interactive and informative dashboard.
- Designed various charts and graphs to present key insights:
  1. **Category with Highest Sale and Peak Date:** Utilized filters to allow category-specific analysis.
  2. **Region-wise Profit and Sale Donut Chart:** Provided insights with filters for sale and profit.
  3. **Weekly Sale Analysis:** Created a Gantt chart with filters similar to the donut chart for consistency.
  4. **Sub-Category Growth by Sale:** Compared sales growth in 2023 to 2022.
  5. **Monthly Sales Growth Comparison:** Used a dual-axis bar chart to visualize 2022 vs. 2023 sales growth.
  6. **Top 5 Products by Region:** Employed a packed bubble chart with regional filters.
  7. **Average Discount and Total Sales:** Combined bar and line charts for a dual-axis visualization.

## Skills Highlighted
- **Data Extraction:** Proficient in using APIs to fetch data from online sources.
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Adept at performing EDA and creating new data fields for enhanced analysis.
- **SQL Proficiency:** Skilled in writing and optimizing complex SQL queries to extract meaningful insights.
- **Data Visualization:** Experienced in using Tableau to create dynamic and interactive dashboards for data presentation.
- **Analytical Thinking:** Demonstrated ability to translate business questions into technical queries and visualizations.

This project not only illustrates my technical capabilities in data handling and analysis but also showcases my ability to derive actionable insights and present them effectively through visualization tools.
